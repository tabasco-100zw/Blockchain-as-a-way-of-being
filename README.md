Blockchain-as-a-way-of-being
This repository is a pure demonstration of my journey into Blockchain Development. In one way or another, I have been in Web 3 for last 5 years of my life. In the past I used to build crypto farms, owned a little trading firm with employees (crypto related). Now, I want to make a deep technical dive into the industry of the free (Rust → Solidity). No LLM used to generate this code (for learning purposes).
 Purpose
This repository documents my day-to-day journey learning blockchain development, with a focus on Rust and its applications in the blockchain space. By sharing my progress, challenges, and projects, I aim to:

Track my own growth and learning path
Create a resource for others on a similar journey
Build a portfolio of blockchain projects that showcase my evolving skills
Connect with the blockchain development community

 Learning Path
My journey follows this general progression:

Mastering Rust - Learning the fundamentals of Rust programming using "The Rust Book"
Rust for Blockchain - Applying Rust knowledge to blockchain concepts
Building Projects - Creating increasingly complex blockchain implementations and applications
Connecting to Existing Ecosystems - Integrating with established blockchain platforms (Most likely: Solana)

 Resources I'm Using

The Rust Programming Language (The Rust Book)
Previous experience with Solidity and blockchain fundamentals
Additional resources will be documented as I discover them throughout my journey

 Contributions & Feedback
While this repository primarily documents my personal journey, I welcome:

Good jokes
Suggestions for resources or learning approaches
Feedback on my code or implementations
Questions about my learning process
Bad jokes

 Long-term Goals
By the end of this journey, I aim to:

Build a fully functional blockchain application in Rust

Contribute to an open-source blockchain project

Bridge my knowledge between Rust and Solidity ecosystems

**Create a solution for the resoource allocation problem in the governance using blockhain technology, specifically mixture of DAOs, Game theory and human cretivity(my own and my friends') at once**

[Additional personal goals as they develop]


This README will evolve as my journey progresses, with new sections and projects added along the way.
